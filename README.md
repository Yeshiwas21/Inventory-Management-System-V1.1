# Inventory Management System

## Project Name: Inventory Management System

### Developer:
- [Yeshiwas Dagnaw]

### Description:
The Inventory Management System is a web application designed to manage inventory requests and approvals. Users can request products, and these requests go through an approval process involving storekeepers and administrators. The system also tracks product quantities, and quantities are updated upon approval.

### Learning Objectives:
- Understand and implement authentication and authorization mechanisms in Django.
- Learn how to design and implement database models for a real-world application.
- Gain experience in creating dynamic forms and handling form submissions in Django.
- Learn how to manage and update data through views and templates.
- Gain experience with version control and collaborative development using Git and GitHub.

### Technologies Used:
- **Backend**: Django
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database**: SQLite (for development), PostgreSQL/MySQL (for production)
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Deployment**: [Heroku/AWS/Any other service if applicable]

### Third-Party Services Used:
- [Specify any third-party services, APIs, or libraries used in the project]

### Challenges Identified:
- Handling concurrent requests and ensuring data consistency.
- Implementing a robust and flexible user roles and permissions system.
- Designing a user-friendly and responsive interface.
- Ensuring data security and protecting against common web vulnerabilities.

### Schedule of Work:
- **Week 1**: Project setup, initial database design, basic user authentication.
- **Week 2**: Implement product request functionality, storekeeper and admin approval workflows.
- **Week 3**: Integrate frontend design, implement dynamic forms and validations.
- **Week 4**: Testing, debugging, and final deployment.

### Mockups:
Include visual representations of key screens in your application, such as:
- **Login Page**: A form where users enter their credentials.
- **Product List Page**: A table displaying products with options to request, edit, or delete.
- **Product Request Form**: A form where users can request products.
- **Approval Pages**: Interfaces for storekeepers and admins to approve or reject requests.
